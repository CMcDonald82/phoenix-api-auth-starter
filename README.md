# phoenix-api-auth-starter

## NOTE: 
This is a work in progress - it is not yet finished or ready to use. I am currently working on this project in my spare time and will update this README once it is ready (by removing this note). Please only use as an example for now (i.e. do not use it to create new projects yet) and feel free to let me know if you have any comments/suggestions/advice. Thanks!


This project is a Phoenix API backend with JWT-based authentication/authorization. It can be used as a starting point for new projects that need this functionality or just as an example of how to implement this functionality with Phoenix.
